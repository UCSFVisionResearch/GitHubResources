To Do
Hands on practice
Git Commandline or not? The software carpentry workshop went pretty smoothly.
Git Advanced or not? (Only if commandline is okay)
Confirm Licensing. Luca used GNU, shall this be required for all or let the Creator choose?
Survey: Offering SWC like workshops/trainings for git regularly? For new users? Pop up sessions?
